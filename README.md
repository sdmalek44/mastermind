# mastermind
A game called mastermind developed in ruby to be played in the terminal. This was my very first project at Turing School. After a user selects their preferred difficulty a random sequence of colors each represented by letter will be generated. A user needs to guess the correct sequence of colors. If they guess wrong the game will tell the user how many colors were correct and how many were in the correct position. Once the user guesses correctly the game will tell the user how long they took to guess correctly and how many guesses it took. The purpose of making this game was to learn how to use basic ruby and test the code with minitest.
